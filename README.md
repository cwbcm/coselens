# Installation
coselenss makes heavy use of dndscv, but a slightly customized version of this package is used under-the-hood and does **not** require installation. However, coselenss does require the following dependencies: ```BiocManager```, ```devtools```, ```seqinr```, ```MASS```, ```GenomicRanges```, ```Biostrings```, ```IRanges```, and ```MASS```. These can be installed by either ```install.packages()``` or ```BiocManager::install()```. To install coselenss use:
```
devtools::install_github("ggruenhagen3/coselenss")
```
