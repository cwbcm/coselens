\title{COnditional SELection on the Excess of NonSynonymous Substitutions (coselenss)}
\usage{
coselenss(group1, group2, subset.genes.by = NULL, refdb = "hg19")
}
\arguments{
\item{group1}{group of individuals (for example those that contain a mutation in a split_gene)}

\item{group2}{another group of individuals that do NOT contain a mutation in a split_gene}

\item{subset.genes.by}{genes to subset results by}

\item{refdb}{Reference database (path to .rda file)}
}
\value{
coselenss returns a dataframe with rows representing and the following columns

\itemize{
\item gene_name: name of gene that conditional selection was calculated in
}

\itemize{
\item num.drivers.group1: estimate of the number of drivers in group 1 based excess of non-synonymous mutations
}

\itemize{
\item num.drivers.group2: estimate of the number of drivers in group 2 based excess of non-synonymous mutations
}

\itemize{
\item pmis: p-value for conditional selection in missense mutations
}

\itemize{
\item ptrunc: p-value for conditional selection in truncating mutations
}

\itemize{
\item pall: p-value for conditional selection in all substitutions (pmis and ptrunc)
}

\itemize{
\item pind: p-value for conditional selection in small indels
}

\itemize{
\item pglobal: Fisher's combined p-value for pall and pind
}

\itemize{
\item qglobal: q-value of pglobal using Benjamini-Hochberg correction
}
}
\description{
Given an input of mutations from two groups of patients, dN/dS is calculated in each of the groups,
and the excess of non-synonymous substitutions between them is found as an estimate for the difference
in the number of driver mutations. For example, one group can be mutations from individuals in a certain
cancer type with mutations in a specific gene vs those without mutations in the specific gene.
A p value is returned for positive conditional selection in each gene in the human reference genome (hg19).
